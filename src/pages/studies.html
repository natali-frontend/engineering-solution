                    Power system studies are essential tools in understanding the expected performance of an electrical
                    system and determining the severity of a fault or other unexpected event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many different types of power system studies, each with their own special purpose and
                    calculation method. Each analysis is unique to a particular power system, any changes within the
                    system can affect the results of the analysis and requires recalculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following types of power system study are the most common studies Engineering Solutions produce:

                        A load flow study determines the active and reactive power, voltage, current, and power factor
                        throughout an electrical system. Load flow studies provide an analysis of all possible operating
                        scenarios and identifies overloaded equipment.

                    <p>
                        Included within the load flow study is a tabulation of the data used to model the system
                        components and a corresponding one-line diagram. Descriptions of the scenarios evaluated and the
                        basis for each are also found within the study, along with:

                            of rated load and the scenario for which the percentage is based, noting any overloaded

                            outside the ranges recommended by equipment manufacturers.

                        The purpose of the short circuit study is to determine the ability of each component within an
                        electrical system to withstand and/or interrupt the system current. Short circuit studies
                        provide an analysis of all possible operating scenarios, which will be influenced by the proposed

                        The purpose of the arc-flash analysis is to determine the arc-flash incident energy levels and
                        flash-protection boundary distances of electrical equipment based on results found in
                        short-circuit and coordination studies. The analysis is performed under worst-case arc-flash
                        conditions for all modes of operation and provides an analysis of all possible operating
                        scenarios which will be, or have been influenced by, the proposed or completed additions to the
                        subject system.

                        Short circuit and coordination studies are performed to determine the available energy of an
                        electrical system and the expected clearing time of protective devices, whereas the arc-flash
                        hazard analysis determines the arc flash boundary and calculates the incident energy at each
                        fault location at the prescribed working distance. Based on this information, the arc-flash
                        hazard PPE category for the calculated incident energy level can be specified along with the arc
                        flash boundary at each fault location.
